      At UNBC, I became a disciplined self-actualizing problem solver.
      My interests at the time were Go (the game), robotics, and Linux.
      While my grades suffered in the beginning, by the end of the program I was an A+ student, earning a 3.3 GPA overall.

      <p class="h3 ml2">
      Software Developer, Zymeworks Inc. <span class="ml2 italic">(2010-)</span>
      </p>
      <p class="ml3">
      My career as a software developer at Zymeworks, a biopharmaceuticals company, began with writing command-line Python applications for scientists.
      I soon graduated to writing scientific workflows for the protein engineering department. One of my workflows, although simple,
      proved to be very successful and was integrated into many standard protein engineering SOPs.
      </p>
      <p class="ml3">
      Over time, I was tasked with more difficult assignments. I've worked on, maintained or integrated most of the software systems at Zymeworks, including a molecular
      dynamics simulator written in C, a protein packing application written in Python, and many others.
      </p>
      <p class="ml3">
      I helped to introduce <a class="black" href="http://www.knime.com">KNIME</a> to Zymeworks, by writing tools that allowed
      <a class="black" href="http://www.knime.com">KNIME</a> to read Zymeworks' proprietary file formats. KNIME became a huge success at Zymeworks,
      and I still maintain many systems related to it today.
      </p>
      <p class="ml3">
      Currently at Zymeworks, my interests and efforts are solidly in the back-end, writing servers in Go backed by PostgresQL. I strive to create simple, robust
      and testable systems that are straightforward to modify and maintain. Recently, I have taken an interest in automation and devops, as the company is growing
      at a fast clip.
      </p>
      <p class="h3 ml2">
      Software Developer, Terahertz Solutions Inc. <span class="ml2 italic">(2009-2010)</span>
      <p class="ml3">
      I implemented the software component of a terahertz radiation scanner used in the forest products industry.
      This product was similar to a scanner, with a data collector that moved back and forth across a factory line.
      I programmed the motion controller and data acquisition system, which were synchronized to collect nanosecond-resolution
      time-series data. Unfortunately, the company could not afford to employ me full-time and I was forced to seek employment elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p class="ml3">
      As the sole developer on this project, I was responsible for every aspect of software development, including programming,
      user interface design, deployment, testing, and automation. While I was far too inexperienced at the time to perform all of these
      roles properly, I was able to deliver a working product that reliably scanned and collected data. The product was written in NI Labview
      and communicated with a data acquisition machine over raw UDP sockets. The motion controller was programmed in a domain-specific language similar to assembler.
      My only teammates were an electrical engineer who designed the robotics hardware, and a physicist who headed the project and developed
      the mathematics for analyzing the terahertz time-series data.

      <p class="h3 ml2">
      IT Administrator, University of Northern British Columbia <span class="ml2 italic">(2008)</span>
      </p>
      <p class="ml3">
      As a temporary replacement systems administrator, I oversaw the operations of the UNBC GIS lab. The GIS lab ran a mixture of Windows 2000 and SuSE Linux,
      and had sophisticated and demanding users who generated massive amounts of data. The job had plenty of challenges, and I was often left to my own devices.
      </p>
      <p class="ml3">
      A few weeks into the job, I realized that the backup system had completely failed due to a software installation and upgrade failure. The system was completely unmonitored.
      I analyzed the backup software execution with <span class="italic courier">strace</span> and discovered that some crucial dependencies were failing to load. Once I installed
      the dependencies, the system came back online. I then coordinated with the UNBC IT department to ensure that the backup system was being monitored by their staff.
      </p>
      <p class="ml3">
      As a budding computer programmer, I wrote software that collected and analyzed disk usage statistics and presented a pie chart of disk usage by user. I discovered that three people were using over 75% of the storage
      provided by the GIS department. This allowed me to coax these users into reducing any unnecessary files, reclaiming many gigabytes of space.

      <ul class="ml3">
        <li>Go, Python, SQL</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="ml3">
      I enjoy using these simple programming languages for building and testing complex systems.
      I am also fluent in C, Java and Bash, and I've had brief adventures in the world of Haskell and Prolog.

      A Linux or Mac OS X machine equipped with VirtualBox, Vagrant, MacVim and Chrome. With these simple tools, I can build powerful apps quickly.

      <p class="ml3">
      I am a focused and motivated individual who enjoys working alone or as part of a team. In a team
      setting, I often take on leadership roles. I am known for being able to learn new things on the job -
      a critical skill for a person in my field. I often take on tasks that I have little or no experience in, and
      succeed.
      </p>
      <p class="ml3">
      In my spare time I enjoy playing guitar, a hobby I have pursued for over 19 years. As for physical
      fitness, I enjoy cycling, running, and skiing. I am an experienced back-country hiker and skier and
      have spent hundreds of hours traversing the mountains of BC.
